compiz uses automake, in order to generate the Makefiles for compiz use:

	$ ./autogen.sh

After that, standard build procedures apply:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	# make install

To build out-of-tree, run:

	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ ../configure

(Or any other directory than build/, of course).
