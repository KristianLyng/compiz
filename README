compiz - OpenGL window and compositing manager

This particular repository is a work in progress to merge various
Compiz-components and make things easier for users and developers alike.


Changes from OLD 0.8
====================

- autogen.sh does NOT run configure now. Run it by hand. (Tip:
  ./autogen.sh; mkdir build; cd build; ../configure; make ... Now you have
  out-of-tree building).
- bcop now included directly and built/distributed. Plugins don't need the
  bcop-binary, just the xslt. See staticswitcher in plugins/Makefile.am.
- plugins-main imported to contrib/ but NOT integrated in the regular
  build. Will be integrated as time permits.
- Silent building
- At the moment I am asking people to file bug reports to
  https://github.com/KristianLyng/compiz . I will also accept pull requests
  if they make sense.
- We will probably need to address versioning sooner or later.

More information to come as it is available.
