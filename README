compiz - OpenGL window and compositing manager

This particular repository is a work in progress to merge various
Compiz-components and make things easier for users and developers alike.

Some components are now added, but not integrated in the actual build yet.
They can still be built, but require you to manually enter the relevant
paths. So far, this includes:

contrib/bcop/
	Configuration-helper for plugins (used by some, but not all plugins)
	
contrib/plugins-main/
	A set of known-good plugins originally from Beryl. Many of these
	require bcop.



More information to come as it is available.
