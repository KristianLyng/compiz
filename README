compiz - OpenGL window and compositing manager

This particular repository is a work in progress to merge various
Compiz-components and make things easier for users and developers alike.

This 0.8.11-based code-base is undergoing some significant changes. Changes
between the 0.8.9-code(which is almost identical to the released 0.8.8) and
0.8.11:

- bcop now included directly and built/distributed. Plugins don't need the
  bcop-binary, just the xslt. See staticswitcher in plugins/Makefile.am.
- plugins-main imported to contrib/ and some plugins moved from
  contrib/plugins-main to plugins/ (ezoom, mousepoll, staticswitcher). The rest 
  does NOT build automatically. All the plugins will be ported one at a
  time.
- At the moment I am asking people to file bug reports to
  https://github.com/KristianLyng/compiz . I will also accept pull requests
  if they make sense.
- Silent building
- autogen.sh does NOT run configure now. Run it by hand. (Tip:
  ./autogen.sh; mkdir build; cd build; ../configure; make ... Now you have
  out-of-tree building).
- We will probably need to address versioning sooner or later.
